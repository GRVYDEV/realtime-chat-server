# ChatServer

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

# NOTE

Room CRUD functionality is not implemented yet. In order to create rooms run mix ecto.setup and then use a tool like PGAdmin or DataGrip to manually insert some chat rooms
